<p>Students who have completed the required lower-level coursework
for the biotechnology major�either within an Associate of Applied
 Science degree program at a community college with which UMUC
 has an articulation agreement or within another appropriate transfer
 program�may seek an academic major in biotechnology. Students
 should consult an advisor before electing this major.</p>

<p>The biotechnology major helps prepare students for the biotechnology
 industry by building on the technical and scientific knowledge gained 
through the associate's degree program and direct experience in the 
field. It combines laboratory skills and applied coursework with a 
biotechnology internship experience and upper-level study.</p>

<p>The biotechnology curriculum covers general biological and chemical 
sciences, biotechniques, bioinstrumentation, bioinformatics, microbiology,
 molecular biology, and cell biology. Study is designed to help students 
who wish to enter pharmaceutical, agricultural, and biomedical research
 industries and organizations as laboratory technicians, quality control 
technicians, assay analysts, chemical technicians, or bioinformaticists.</p>
