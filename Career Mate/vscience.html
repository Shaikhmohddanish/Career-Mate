<p>The Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc or BVSC),
"Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine" (BVetMed), or 
"Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery" 
("BVM&S" or "BVMS") is a bachelor's degree for 
studies in veterinary science in the United Kingdom
and some other countries. These degrees qualify one
 to practice as a veterinarian in the US if the degree is
 conferred from an American Veterinary Medical Association 
(AVMA) accredited school and the candidate passes the 
National Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners (NAVLE)
 exam, just as any other US and Canada graduate.</p>
 
<p>They are the UK's equivalent to DVM/VMD degrees; the main 
equalizer being licensure in the US. They are not called 
"doctorate" degrees due to nomenclature differences among
 degree designations between the US and Canada and the
 UK. In the UK, a doctorate degree designation is reserved
for advanced academic degrees resulting in a thesis 
publication and dissertation, as in a PhD. However, if a
 graduate with a BVSc (BVSC, BVMS, etc) does practice
 in the US, they are entitled to use the title "Dr".</p>

<p>It is generally a 5-year course. (Cambridge Veterinary
 School's course lasts 6 years and awards a BA after 3
 years, followed by the VetMB after 6 years). Some
 universities will award the students a BSc after the first
 3 years, and the BVSc after the final 2 years.</p>

<p>The degree is generally required for becoming a veterinarian
 in the countries where it is awarded.</p>
