<p>The Bachelor of Technology (commonly abbreviated as BTech and
 Honours is BTech (Hons)) is an undergraduate academic degree
 conferred after completion of a three or four-year program of studies
 at an accredited university or accredited university-level institution.
 The degree is conferred in the Commonwealth of Nations, the United
 States and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In general, the degree is awarded to those who have undertaken
 a degree program which is supplemented by either occupational 
placements (e.g. supervised practice or internships), practice-based
 classroom courses, or associate degrees. Due to these requirements, 
the degree normally takes at least four years.</p>

<p>In some countries, the degree is awarded following completion of a 
curriculum which is career oriented, emphasizing practice as opposed 
to theory.</p>
<p>In India, the Bachelor of Technology degree is a professional engineering
 degree awarded after completion of 4-years of extensive/vast engineering
 study and research. In India B.Tech. is otherwise called as BEng/BE. 
Some universities offer it as B Tech & some as BEng/BE. However, the name

 a B.Tech. degree and private institutes which are affiliated to regional 
universities confer BE degree.</p>
